           <h3><b>Bears</b></h3>
           <p>The American black bear is the most common species of bear in North American forests. 
            Although called black bears, these animals come in varying colors. The American black b
            ear has subspecies with whitish fur, called the spirit bear or Kermode bear.

           <h3><b>Giraffes</b></h3> 
           <p> Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. 
            A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.

            <h3><b>Lions</b></h3>
            <p>Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides—though there is one 
                population of solitary lions. Prides are family units that may comprise anywhere from 
                two to 40 lions—including up to to three or four males, a dozen or so females, and their young.

            <h3><b>Monkeys</b></h3>
            <p>As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics 
                that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well. Williams et al. outlined evolutionary 
                features, including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates such as the tarsiers 
                and the lemuriformes

            <h3><b>Alligators</b></h3>
            <p>Adult alligators are apex predators critical to the biodiversity of their habitat. They feed 
                mainly on fish, turtles, snakes, and small mammals. However, they are opportunists, and a 
                hungry gator will eat just about anything, including carrion, pets and, in rare instances, humans.
